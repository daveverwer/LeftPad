# LeftPad

This is a sample package to demonstrate adding additional metadata to a Package.swift file. It should never be used in production. I implemented a `leftPad` extension to `String` purely because of a little piece of [internet history](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/).

## Revision History

- `1.0.0` - The original, and what many consider to be the best release.
- `1.0.1` - Added a testimonial to the README file, increasing padding performance by 0%.
- `1.1.0` - Oh my, what a release this was. Swift 4.2 support, bug fixes (yes, really), and so much more.
- `2.0` - The "not really a release", release to test partial semantic version numbers.
- `2.1.0` - The "let's get LeftPad back on a semantic version" release. Also added a `.spi.yml` for DocC generation.
