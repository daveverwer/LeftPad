# LeftPad

This is a sample package to demonstrate adding additional metadata to a Package.swift file. It should never be used in production. I implemented a `leftPad` extension to `String` purely because of a little piece of [internet history](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/).
